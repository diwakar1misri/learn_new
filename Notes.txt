MongoDB is the one which uses the concept of NoSQL

Q. What is the Mongo and Mongo D ?
Ans. It can be understood as :-
Mongo is like a Programming language and Mongo D is the compiler like structure which help in running the background parts like collecting data from database 
connecting to the host , manages all the background activity.

Mongo DB commands
1. show dbs; -> To see the list of the databases
2. use <database name>--> To create the new database
3. db -> To see the current database 

Note: while using "use <new database name>" to will reflect in the show dbs only when you have in database when there is atleast one table(collection)
also some things name change in Mongo DB that we generally use in the sql which are:
DB ------------------->DB
Tables---------------->Collection
Rows------------------>Document

4. db is the object or the current database we are in and it acts like an object and it is having some functions:
	->db.CreateCollection('<table name>') --> Used for creating collection or if we conentionally say we 
	->
5. show collections -> It is used to find tables present in the database 

Note: There are two ways of creating the tables :
	1. db.createCollection()
	2. db.<new table name>.insert({values})
However the advantage of using the 1st over the second is : db.createCollection('<table name>',{capped=true,size="size in bytes",max="no of rows"})

There are two types of the document:
1. Embedded document -> They are those kind of document which contain one docuent inside another document
2. Relational document

When you want to insert multiple data in the insert statement then the possible way of doing it is :
varr arr=[{},{},{}]
